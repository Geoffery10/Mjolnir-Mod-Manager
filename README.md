## Security Concerns

Due to how most modern virus protections work this app is likely to be flagged as potentially dangerous. This is for a few reasons which are listed below.
* This app is very new and most virus protections have never seen it.
* It is compiled into an exe which while conveniant for you makes virus protection suspisous. 
* It modifies files to install mods and make backups.

However if you are concerned about security I urge you to read to source code or if you want install using the python script (Uncompiled).

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Python 3.10.4](https://www.python.org/)
